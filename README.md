# Functions Lens Eventbrite

This project combines [Chainlink Functions](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions) with [Lens Publication Actions](https://docs.lens.xyz/v2/docs/publication-actions-aka-open-actions) to demonstrate how one can generate discount codes for events on Eventbrite using Collect module.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Current LTS Node.js version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## Getting Started

1. Install packages

```
npm install
```

2. Compile contracts

```
forge build
```

## What are we building?

Using Chainlink Functions and Lens Publication Actions, we are going to develop a system for generating discount codes for events (like Smartcon or Raave for example) hosted on Eventbrite.

The event organizer will need to create a new event on Eventbrite, following [these instructions](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/551351/how-to-create-an-event).

To develop and use this project, you will need to obtain a [free Eventbrite OAUTH token](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/849962/generate-an-api-key/).

Once you generate an Eventbrite OAUTH token, you can visit the following web page to validate it works as expected `https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/users/me/?token=<YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_GOES_HERE>`

Next, you will need to get your

- **Organization ID**, by visiting `https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/users/me/organizations/?token=<YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_GOES_HERE>`
- **Event ID**, by visiting `https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID_GOES_HERE>/events/?token=<YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_GOES_HERE>`

The core logic is stored in the [`DiscountPublicationAction.sol`](./src/DiscountPublicationAction.sol) smart contract which implements `IPublicationActionModule` and `FunctionsClient` interfaces. On Lens collect, it will make a Chainlink Functions request to execute the JavaScript code from the [`source.js`](./source.js) file, which will resolve User's address to a Lens handle and generate the Eventbrite discount code for the provided event. The [`DiscountPublicationAction.sol`](./src/DiscountPublicationAction.sol) smart contract will then store the returned discount code.

## Usage

For setting up environment variables we are going to use the [`@chainlink/env-enc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/env-enc) package for extra security. It encrypts sensitive data instead of storing them as plain text in the `.env` file, by creating a new, `.env.enc` file. Although it's not recommended to push this file online, if that accidentally happens your secrets will still be encrypted.

1. Set a password for encrypting and decrypting the environment variable file. You can change it later by typing the same command.

```shell
npx env-enc set-pw
```

2. Now set the `OAUTH_KEY` environment variable by typing:

```shell
npx env-enc set
```

After you are done, the `.env.enc` file will be automatically generated.

If you want to validate your inputs you can always run the following command:

```shell
npx env-enc view
```

3. Run local simulation

```
forge test -vvv --ffi
```

## Deployment

To deploy [`DiscountPublicationAction.sol`](./src/DiscountPublicationAction.sol) smart contract, prepare the following constructor arguments:

- `hub` - The address of a Lens' [LensHub](https://docs.lens.xyz/v2/docs/deployed-contract-addresses#mumbai-developer-preview) smart contract
- `moduleGlobals` - The address of a Lens' [ModuleGlobals](https://docs.lens.xyz/v2/docs/deployed-contract-addresses#mumbai-developer-preview) smart contract
- `router` - The address of a Chainlink [Functions Router](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) smart contract
- `subscriptionId` - The ID of your Chainlink Functions subscription which you can create at [Functions Subscription Manager](https://functions.chain.link/) following steps from the [Official Documentation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions)
- `callbackGasLimit` - The [maximum gas](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client) that Chainlink Functions can use when transmitting the response to your contract
- `donIdBytes32` - The ID of a Chainlink Functions [DON to be invoked](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/supported-networks). This needs to be converted to `bytes32` with `cast --format-bytes32-string "fun-polygon-mumbai-1"` or via etherjs with `node getDonIdBytes.js fun-polygon-mumbai-1`.

Then run the `forge create` command:

```
forge create --rpc-url <your_rpc_url> \
    --private-key <your_private_key> \
    --constructor-args <hub> <moduleGlobals> <router> <subscriptionId> <callbackGasLimit> <donIdBytes32> \
    --etherscan-api-key <your_etherscan_api_key> \
    --verify \
    --legacy \
    src/DiscountPublicationAction.sol:DiscountPublicationAction
```

Make a note of your deployed contract.

Then Head to the [Lens V2 ModuleGlobals Contract on Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x8834aE494ADD3C56d274Fe88243526DBAB15dEF8) and from the `Contracts` tab, click on `Write as Proxy`.  Connect your wallet to the page, and then call `registerModule` with the following arguments:
- `moduleAddress` : the Open Action with Functions contract you just deployed
- `moduleType`:  1  (Enum for Open Action) ([ref](https://docs.lens.xyz/v2/docs/publishing-a-module))
